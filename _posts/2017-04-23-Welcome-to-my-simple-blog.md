### Few keywords about me
I want learn to programming, because I like it. I choose html + javascript because I fast see the result of my work. I will write, maybe I will try write for english, because I must know more this language. Please for feedback, for it will help me in my learning. I forget write that this project will have help me understand and learn to how to use git, but not only basics functions, but more advanced. We will see what will happen. And I will use only git bash, because we like console, right?

I will be write here all about my project, my learning, my troubles, and questions to you. Worst that I dont know how my project how should it look like, what I want etc. Maybe features like that:

Main site with few buttons, example: Search animal, list all animal, list animal according type, etc.,
Add/remove animal,
Save all in browser local storage. If I find new interesting features I will add this to above list.
