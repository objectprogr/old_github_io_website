## Why I started the course?
I like Java language more than frontend language. I'm not a artist and desginer, so Java is better choice for me. Java fascinated me, her possibilities.
If I try learning alone never finish my project. I have little perseverance. I must feel some whip over my head. In this case, my whip is price which I paid for this course. And this is good for me! I know myself :D
I starded yesterday and I try focus on all issues. Though I earlier learn Java and I know basics.

## A little about the course itself
I choice course "Java basic course" from [JavaStart](https://javastart.pl/){:target="_blank"}. Why PL website? Because I do not know enghlish enough. 
Course is focused mainly on practice and connects previously learned part of the whole part. Along with progress in learning, We develop small program in which add new elements and refactor our code when we knowing new better functions Java language. This solve is amazing! This teaches us how to use new features and how to modernize our project/program. Great!
Except that course have a quizzes that help consolidate knowledge. Theory is minimal in favor of practice. Nice!
